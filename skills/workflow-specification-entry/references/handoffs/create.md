Saving session state so Claude can pick up where it left off if the conversation is compacted.
```

```bash
.claude/hooks/workflows/write-session-state.sh \
  "{work_unit}" \
  "skills/technical-specification/SKILL.md" \
  ".workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md"
```

This skill's purpose is now fulfilled. Invoke the [technical-specification](../../../technical-specification/SKILL.md) skill for your next instructions. Do not act on the gathered information until the skill is loaded — it contains the instructions for how to proceed.

```

Sources:
- .workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{discussion-name}.md
- .workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{discussion-name}.md

Output: .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md

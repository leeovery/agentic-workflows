# Assess Cross-Cutting & Conclude

*Reference for **[workflow-specification-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

## A. Cross-Cutting Assessment

#### If work_type is `epic`

Before asking for sign-off, assess whether this specification defines cross-cutting patterns rather than something to build directly.

**Cross-cutting indicators** — Patterns/policies that inform other work:
- Defines "how to do things" rather than "what to build"
- Will be referenced by multiple specifications
- Implementation happens within features that apply these patterns

**Directly plannable indicators** — Something to build:
- Has concrete deliverables (code, APIs, UI)
- Can be planned with phases, tasks, acceptance criteria
- Results in a standalone implementation

Present your assessment to the user:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Cross-Cutting Assessment

@if(cross_cutting)
This specification appears to be cross-cutting.
@else
This specification is directly plannable — no cross-cutting promotion needed.
@endif

{Brief rationale — e.g., "It defines a caching strategy that will inform how
multiple features handle data retrieval, rather than being a standalone piece
of functionality to build."}
```

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Confirm this assessment?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Confirm assessment
- **Comment** — Suggest a different classification
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If comment:**

Discuss the user's suggested classification and re-assess.

→ Return to **A. Cross-Cutting Assessment**.

**If `yes`:**

Store the confirmed assessment for use in Section F.

→ Proceed to **B. Verify Tracking Files Complete**.

#### Otherwise

No assessment needed — feature, bugfix, and cross-cutting work types always produce directly plannable specifications.

→ Proceed to **B. Verify Tracking Files Complete**.

---

## B. Verify Tracking Files Complete

Before proceeding to sign-off, confirm that all review tracking files across all cycles have `status: complete`:

- `review-input-tracking-c{N}.md` — should be marked complete after each Phase 1
- `review-gap-analysis-tracking-c{N}.md` — should be marked complete after each Phase 2

If any tracking file still shows `status: in-progress`, mark it complete now.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed to sign-off if any tracking files still show `status: in-progress`. They indicate incomplete review work.

→ Proceed to **C. Sign-Off**.

## C. Sign-Off

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Ready to conclude?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Conclude specification and mark as completed
- **Comment** — Add context before concluding
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If comment

Discuss the user's context and apply any changes.

→ Return to **C. Sign-Off**.

#### If `yes`

→ Proceed to **D. Update Manifest and Conclude**.

---

## D. Update Manifest and Conclude

Update the specification metadata via manifest CLI:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {work_unit}.specification.{topic} status completed
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {work_unit}.specification.{topic} date $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

Specification is complete when:
- All topics have validated content
- All sources are marked as `incorporated`
- At least one review cycle completed with no findings, OR user explicitly chose to proceed past the re-loop prompt
- All review tracking files marked `status: complete`
- User confirms the specification is complete
- No blocking gaps remain

Commit: `spec({work_unit}): conclude specification`

Index the completed artifact into the knowledge base:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs index .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md
```

If the index command fails, display the error but do not block — the artifact is already saved:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
⚑ Knowledge indexing warning
  {error details}
  The artifact is saved. Indexing can be retried later.
```

→ Proceed to **E. Handle Source Specifications**.

---

## E. Handle Source Specifications

If any of your sources were **existing specifications** (as opposed to discussions, research, or other reference material), these have now been consolidated into the new specification.

1. Mark each source specification as superseded via manifest CLI:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {work_unit}.specification.{source-topic} status superseded
   node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {work_unit}.specification.{source-topic} superseded_by {topic}
   ```
2. Remove superseded spec chunks from the knowledge base (per source topic):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs remove --work-unit {work_unit} --phase specification --topic {source-topic}
```

If the remove command fails, display the error but do not block — the supersession is already recorded:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
⚑ Knowledge removal warning
  {error details}
  The spec is superseded. The removal has been queued and will retry automatically on the next `knowledge remove` or `knowledge compact` call.
```

3. Inform the user which topics were updated
4. Commit: `spec({work_unit}): mark source specifications as superseded`

→ Proceed to **F. Pipeline Continuation**.

---

## F. Pipeline Continuation

#### If work_type is `epic` and assessment was `cross-cutting`

→ Load **[promote-to-cross-cutting.md](promote-to-cross-cutting.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

#### Otherwise

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Specification complete. The planning phase will break this into
> implementable tasks with dependencies and acceptance criteria.
```

Invoke the bridge:

```
Pipeline bridge for: {work_unit}
Completed phase: specification

Invoke the workflow-bridge skill to enter plan mode with continuation instructions.
```

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.

# Investigation Plan

*Reference for **[workflow-investigation-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Form hypotheses and agree the shape of the analysis before deep tracing begins. The seed material, symptoms, and knowledge base results often carry a strong lead — recon turns them into an explicit plan the user can steer.

## A. Recon

A bounded first pass — enough to form hypotheses, never the investigation itself:

- Re-read the seed material and gathered symptoms; note any hypothesis they already carry
- Locate the entry points implicated by the symptoms and skim the surrounding code
- Check what the contextual query surfaced — a prior investigation may already point at the mechanism

Form the initial hypotheses. Each needs a one-line basis (what points at it), not proof. If the seed material already pinpoints the cause, say so — a single near-confirmed hypothesis is a valid plan.

Deep tracing belongs to code analysis. If recon starts confirming rather than forming, stop and plan.

→ Proceed to **B. Present Plan**.

## B. Present Plan

Choose the checkpoint depth to propose:

- **`straight-through`** — the bug looks contained, the mechanism is near-confirmed, or the trace lines are few. Analysis runs without check-ins; the next gate is findings sign-off.
- **`check-ins`** — multiple systems, speculative hypotheses, intermittent symptoms, or anywhere the user's knowledge could redirect the trace. Analysis pauses briefly as hypotheses resolve.

The depth is a suggestion — the user decides.

Trace lines:
  • {code path or area to trace, in intended order}

Depth: {depth:[straight-through|check-ins]} — {one-line reasoning}

Does this plan look right?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Proceed with the analysis as planned
- **Adjust** — Tell me what to change: hypotheses, trace lines, or depth
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

→ Proceed to **C. Record**.

#### If the user adjusts

Incorporate the changes — add or drop hypotheses, re-order trace lines, switch the depth.

→ Return to **B. Present Plan**.

## C. Record

Write the agreed plan into the Hypotheses section of the investigation file: the checkpoint depth, then each hypothesis with status `[suspected]` and its basis. Commit (`investigation({work_unit}): investigation plan`).

→ Return to caller.
